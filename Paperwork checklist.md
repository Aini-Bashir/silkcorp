## Checklist for SILK Franchise Paperwork and Agreements

- [ ] Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD): This is a legal document that franchisors must provide to franchisees at least 14 days before they sign any agreement or pay 
      any money to the franchisor. It includes information about the franchisor, the franchise system, the costs of the franchise, and other important details.
- [ ] Franchise agreement: This is a legal agreement between the franchisor (SILK) and the franchisee (customer) that outlines the terms and conditions of the franchise
      relationship, including the use of SILK's brand, products, and services.
- [ ] Business license: This is a permit issued by a government agency that allows the franchisee to operate their business legally. The requirements for obtaining a 
      business license vary by location and industry.
- [ ] Insurance: The franchisee will need to obtain insurance to protect their business and customers. This may include general liability insurance, property insurance, 
     and other types of coverage.
- [ ] Lease Agreement: If the franchisee is leasing a commercial space for their business, they will need to sign a lease agreement with the landlord. This outlines the
      terms of the lease, including the rent, lease length, and other important details.
- [ ] Trademark licence: This may be a separate document or dealt with in the body of the franchise agreement. Its purpose is to specifically licence to the franchisee
      the right to use the franchisorâ€™s trademarks.

      - or access to - the manual after completion of their training and once the franchise agreement has been signed.

- [ ] Training Agreement: A legal agreement between SILK and the franchisee that outlines the training requirements and procedures for running the franchise business.

      income statements, and cash flow statements.
